---

# ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

The current version supports only Linux OS and was tested on an AMD64 platform with EXT4 and XFS file systems.

### Start With Docker

The easiest way to start using Reduct Storage is to run Docker image:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 -v ${PWD}/data:/data ghcr.io/reduct-storage/reduct-storage:main 
```

The storage will be available on port http://127.0.01:8383 and stores data in the `./data` directory. You may check if it's working with a simple HTTP request:

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8383/info
```

### Build Manually

To build the storage from source code, you need:

* GCC 11.2 or higher
* CMake 18 or higher
* conan

On Ubuntu 21.10 you can install with:

```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3-pip
sudo pip3 install conan
```

After all the requirements are installed, you can build the storage:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j
```

Finally, you can launch the storage:

```
RS_DATA_PATH=./data bin/reduct-storage
```

## Environment Variables

The storage can be customized with the following environmental variables:

| Name                | Default   | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RS\_LOG\_LEVEL      | INFO      | Logging level, can be: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR                           |
| RS\_HOST            | 0.0.0.0   | Listening IP address                                                                |
| RS\_PORT            | 8383      | Listening port                                                                      |
| RS\_API\_BASE\_PATH | /         | Prefix for all URLs of requests                                                     |
| RS\_DATA\_PATH      | /data     | Path to a folder where the storage stores the data                                  |
| RS\_API\_TOKEN      |           | If set, the storage uses [token authorization](broken-reference)                    |
| RS\_CERT\_PATH      |           | Path to an SSL certificate. If unset, the storage uses HTTP instead of HTTPS        |
| RS\_CERT\_KEY\_PATH |           | Path to the private key of the desired SSL certificate. Should be set with RS\_CERT\_PATH       |
