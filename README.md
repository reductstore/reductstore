ReductStore is a time series database designed specifically for storing and managing large amounts of blob data. It has
high performance for writing and real-time querying, making it suitable for edge computing, computer vision, and IoT
applications. ReductStore is 100% open source under Mozilla Public License v2.0.
It has a simple HTTP API and provides random access to data via a timestamp or time interval. Read
more [here](https://docs.reduct.store/).

## Features:

* HTTP(S) API
* Storing and accessing blobs as time series
* Optimized for small files
* Real-time FIFO quota for buckets
* Token authorization
* Labeling and searching
* Embedded Web Console
* Support Linux, MacOS and Windows on AMD64

## Get started

The easiest way to start is to use Docker image:

```shell
docker run -p 8383:8383 -v ${PWD}/data:/data reductstore/reductstore:latest
```

or you can use the demo instance https://play.reduct.store/ with API token `reduct`.

See [Getting Started](https://docs.reduct.store/) and [Download](https://www.reduct.store/download) pages for deail.

## Usage Example

ReductStore provides a simple HTTP API, so you could use it with `curl`:

```shell
# Create a bucket
curl -d "{\"quota_type\":\"FIFO\", \"quota_size\":10000}" \
  -X POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/b/my_data"

# Write two records with timestamp 10000 and 20000
curl -d "some_data_1" \
  -X POST \
  --header "x-reduct-label-quality: good" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/b/my_data/entry_1?ts=10000"

curl -d "some_data_2" \
  -X POST \
    --header "x-reduct-label-quality: bad" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/b/my_data/entry_1?ts=20000"

# Query all records in the bucket (TTL of request 10000s, so you don't need to hurry)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/b/my_data/entry_1/q?ttl=10000"

# Take ID from the response and read the data until the end
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8383/api/v1/b/my_data/entry_1?q=<ID_FROM_RESPONSE>"
```
